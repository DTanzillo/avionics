# JSC: ISP Rocket Simulation
Chief Element Scientist: Dominic Tanzillo

Apprentice: Mina Kian

Under severe construction.

## Programs

### trajectory_calc.py 
Currently, the only functional program. It will provide a quick simulation of the rocket. 
Basically, a glorified parabola solver right now.

### matrix_trajectory.py
Good God I have no idea what this is supposed to do.

### transformation_matrices.py
Makes very pretty graphs, proving that graphs could have been included in trajectory_calc.py but weren't.
